  <div class="article-body">
    <p>
      Every enterprise AI roadmap now includes "multi-agent systems" somewhere between Q2 and Q4. The pitch is seductive: instead of one monolithic AI, you deploy a constellation of specialised agents that collaborate, each handling a different slice of the workflow. A collections agent that prioritises debtors. A forecasting agent that adjusts cash projections. A reconciliation agent that matches payments. An orchestrator that coordinates them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      On paper, it's elegant. In practice, most of these implementations will fail. Not because the technology isn't ready, but because the people designing them have never operated the systems they're connecting.
    </p>

    <h2>The Orchestration Layer Is the Product</h2>
    <p>
      Here's what most architecture diagrams get wrong: they focus on the agents. Agent A does cash forecasting. Agent B does dunning. Agent C does reconciliation. The arrows between them are thin lines labelled "data flow" or "triggers." And that's where the entire design collapses.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Those thin lines are the product.</strong> The orchestration layer, the system that decides when agents act, what context they share, how conflicts resolve, and what happens when an agent is wrong, is where 80% of the complexity lives. The individual agents are the easy part. Getting them to work together in a production environment where real money moves and real covenants can be breached? That's the hard part.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spent seven years inside treasury operations at a European unicorn. I watched what happens when systems don't talk to each other properly. Cash forecasts that moved 50% from one week to the next. Securitisation advance rates threatening to drop below covenant thresholds at 2am. Twenty spreadsheets trying to reconcile what five different ERPs said about the same transaction. The cost of bad orchestration isn't a failed demo. It's a lender converting your debt into equity because your systems disagreed about your cash position.
    </p>

    <h2>Five Reasons Enterprise Multi-Agent Systems Will Fail</h2>

    <h3>1. Agents need shared state, not just shared prompts</h3>
    <p>
      Most multi-agent architectures pass messages. Agent A sends a result to Agent B. Agent B processes it and sends output to Agent C. This works beautifully in demos and completely breaks in production.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enterprise operations have <strong>shared mutable state</strong>. A payment comes in that affects the cash forecast, the collections priority queue, the reconciliation pipeline, and the credit risk score of the counterparty, all simultaneously. If each agent maintains its own state and updates asynchronously, you get a system that's technically correct at the agent level but incoherent at the business level. The collections agent deprioritises a debtor because Agent C reconciled a payment, but the forecasting agent hasn't updated yet, so it's still projecting a shortfall that triggers an unnecessary covenant alert.
    </p>
    <p>
      The solution isn't faster message passing. It's a shared state layer that agents read from and write to with transactional guarantees. And designing that layer requires understanding which business objects are coupled, which is domain knowledge you can't prompt-engineer into existence.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Error propagation is non-linear</h3>
    <p>
      In a single-agent system, when the AI is wrong, a human catches it. In a multi-agent system, Agent A's error becomes Agent B's input, which becomes Agent C's confident assertion. The error doesn't just propagate: it compounds and decorates itself with false precision.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've seen this exact dynamic in manual operations. A misclassified payment in one country's ERP creates a cascade: wrong cash position, wrong forecast, wrong collection priority, wrong covenant compliance report. When humans did this, the cascade took days to unfold and someone usually caught it. With agents operating in real-time, the cascade completes in seconds. By the time a human reviews the output, five downstream decisions have already been made based on corrupted data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Multi-agent architectures need <strong>circuit breakers</strong>: when an agent's confidence drops below a threshold, downstream agents pause and the system escalates to human review. But setting those thresholds correctly requires understanding which errors are recoverable and which are catastrophic, and that depends entirely on the domain.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Most enterprise data isn't agent-ready</h3>
    <p>
      The multi-agent vision assumes clean, structured, accessible data. The reality in most enterprises is quite different. Payment data lives in ERPs with different schemas per country. Customer data is split between CRM and billing systems with conflicting identifiers. Historical records mix accounting periods, currencies, and reporting conventions.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spent years building a data foundation precisely because agents can't function without one. The unglamorous work of normalising ERP data, building a single Redshift data mart, defining validation rules that catch quality issues at ingestion. That work took months and required understanding not just the data structures but the business logic behind why a payment in Spain is classified differently from one in Germany.
    </p>
    <p>
      Multi-agent systems don't solve the data problem. They amplify it. Agents that operate on inconsistent data will produce inconsistent results with high confidence. The most dangerous system is one that's wrong and articulate about it.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Human-in-the-loop isn't a checkbox</h3>
    <p>
      Every multi-agent architecture includes a box labelled "human review" somewhere in the flow. That box is usually the least-specified component in the entire system.
    </p>
    <p>
      In production, human-in-the-loop is an architecture decision, not a feature. Which decisions require approval? At what confidence threshold? What context does the human need to evaluate the recommendation? How long can the system wait for human input before the decision becomes stale? What happens if the human disagrees with three agents simultaneously?
    </p>
    <p>
      When I designed the AI governance framework for our treasury platform, every decision type had a defined autonomy level. Payment prediction scoring: no approval needed, informational only. Dunning email content: human approval before sending. Cash forecast adjustments: treasury sign-off required. Credit limit changes: credit manager approval. Each level has different latency tolerances, different context requirements, and different escalation paths. That granularity isn't optional. Without it, you either slow everything down to human speed (defeating the purpose of automation) or you let agents make decisions they shouldn't (creating liability).
    </p>

    <h3>5. The orchestrator is the hardest role to fill</h3>
    <p>
      Who designs the orchestration layer? Not the ML engineers: they build great agents but often don't understand the business workflows those agents operate within. Not the domain experts: they understand the workflows but can't reason about agent architectures, confidence calibration, or failure modes. Not the traditional product managers: most of them are still thinking in features and user stories, not in agent behaviours and system dynamics.
    </p>
    <p>
      The person who designs the orchestration layer needs to hold three mental models simultaneously: how the business process actually works (including the exceptions and edge cases that nobody documented), how agents process information and where they fail, and how the combined system creates emergent behaviour that no individual agent was designed for.
    </p>
    <p>
      That person is rare. In treasury alone, I estimate fewer than 50 people in Europe combine deep operational experience with genuine AI product design capability. Scale that across every enterprise function that's adopting multi-agent systems, and you start to see the bottleneck.
    </p>

    <h2>What a Well-Designed Multi-Agent System Actually Looks Like</h2>
    <p>
      The implementations that will succeed share three characteristics:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Shared state with transactional guarantees.</strong> All agents read from and write to a common data layer. State changes are atomic and observable. When one agent updates a cash position, every other agent sees the change before making its next decision. This is harder to build than independent agents, but it's the difference between a demo and a production system.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Circuit breakers and confidence propagation.</strong> Every agent output carries a confidence score. When an agent's input comes from another agent with low confidence, the downstream confidence degrades accordingly. Below a threshold, the system pauses and escalates. The thresholds are set by people who understand the cost of different types of errors in the specific domain.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Graduated autonomy.</strong> Not all decisions are equal. A well-designed system classifies decisions by reversibility, financial impact, and domain complexity. Reversible, low-impact decisions are fully autonomous. Irreversible, high-impact decisions require human approval. The graduation isn't static: as the system builds a track record, autonomy levels can increase. But the starting point should always be conservative, and the escalation path should always be clear.
    </p>

    <h2>The Operator Advantage, Again</h2>
    <p>
      This is the same argument I've made about AI product management generally, but it's even more acute in multi-agent systems. The orchestration layer, the part that makes or breaks the implementation, requires deep understanding of operational reality. Not the documented process. The actual one. The exceptions, the workarounds, the informal knowledge that lives in people's heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can't design circuit breakers for treasury agents if you've never experienced a covenant breach scare at 2am. You can't set confidence thresholds for a collections agent if you've never seen a misclassified payment cascade across five countries. You can't architect shared state if you don't know which business objects are actually coupled in the real workflow, not the diagram.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The multi-agent future is real. But it will be built by people who understand the space between the agents, not just the agents themselves.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Most of the enterprise multi-agent implementations launching in 2026 and 2027 will underperform expectations. Not because the agents aren't smart enough, but because the orchestration wasn't designed by someone who's lived inside the system. The technology is ready. The architecture patterns exist. The bottleneck is people who can hold the operational complexity and the agent architecture in their head at the same time, and design the layer where they meet.
